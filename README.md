# Cosmic-Clash

Description:
  - The motivation behind this project was the interest in making a text based game like `Oregon Trail` which ended up shifting focus into a more turn based game such as `BattleShip`. We decided on making `BattleShip` as our project because we wanted it to stand out when presenting in class. As for solving problems our project solves BOREDOM by allowing users to play our game on desktop or mobile which allows you to bring the fun anywhere. We learned A LOT during this project but two of the biggest things we learned was how to use REACT and MUTATIONS.
